- This game is a very classic game, I tried to redesign it to match an insperaition from LSD ft. Sia song (Genius) in colors and concept.
I hope you enjoy the classic with the joy of colors.

- Usually the game is simple, 2 players choose either x or o symbols, in order to score three boxes in a row of your chosen symbol.

- I have used (HTML, CSS, JQuery)

- I am planning to get creative in this game by adding designs and audio.

-  I have struggled with the logic and with chosing a game, but I had fun in this project. 
I am so proud of myself even though the result is not satisfying to what I expected. 

- Special Thanks to Ghadeer and Trevor for helping while figuring out how to write the logic.
